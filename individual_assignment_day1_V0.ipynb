    "This assignment focuses on the following scenarios:\n",
    "* Tool Use with Wikipedia: Implementing function calling with Wikipedia integration\n",

    "## Assignment Structure: Tool Use with Wikipedia Integration \n",
    "Objective: Create a research assistant that can search Wikipedia and provide comprehensive information using OpenAI's function calling capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements:\n",
    "* Wikipedia Search Function: Implement a function to search Wikipedia articles\n",
    "* Content Extraction: Extract and summarize article content\n",
    "* Function Calling: Use OpenAI's function calling to integrate Wikipedia data\n",
    "* Structured Output: Return information in a structured format\n",
    "* Error Handling: Handle cases where articles don't exist or are ambiguous\n",

       "**What is a Neural Network?**\n",
       "\n",
       "A neural network is a type of computer program that is designed to recognize patterns and make decisions, similar to how the human brain works. It's made up of simple units called neurons that are connected like a web.\n",
       "\n",
       "**How Does It Work?**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Neurons**: Just like neurons in your brain, these artificial neurons process information. Each neuron receives input (like data) from other neurons or from outside sources.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Layers**: Neural networks are organized in layers:\n",
       "   - **Input Layer**: This is where the neural network gets its data. For example, if it’s recognizing photos of cats, this layer will receive pixel values from the images.\n",
       "   - **Hidden Layers**: These layers perform calculations and transformations on the inputs. There can be multiple hidden layers that help the network learn more complex features.\n",
       "   - **Output Layer**: This layer gives the final decision or prediction. For instance, it might say “cat” or “not a cat” based on what it learned.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Connections and Weights**: Each connection between neurons has a weight, which determines how much influence one neuron has on another. During training, these weights are adjusted so that the output gets closer to the correct answer.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Learning Process**\n",
       "\n",
       "Neural networks learn through a process called **training**. During this phase, they are shown a lot of example data along with the correct answers. The network tries to guess the answers, and when it makes mistakes, it adjusts its connections (weights) to improve. \n",
       "\n",
       "**Applications**\n",
       "\n",
       "Neural networks are used in many areas, including:\n",
       "- **Image Recognition**: Recognizing faces or objects in photos.\n",
       "- **Speech Recognition**: Understanding spoken words, like in voice assistants.\n",
       "- **Playing Games**: Neural networks can learn to play video games or board games.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, a neural network mimics the way our brains learn and make decisions, helping computers tackle a wide array of complex tasks!"
