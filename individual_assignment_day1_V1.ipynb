    "This assignment focuses on the following scenarios:\n",
    "* Tool Use with Wikipedia: Implementing function calling with Wikipedia integration\n",

    "## Assignment Structure: Tool Use with Wikipedia Integration \n",
    "Objective: Create a research assistant that can search Wikipedia and provide comprehensive information using OpenAI's function calling capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements:\n",
    "* Wikipedia Search Function: Implement a function to search Wikipedia articles\n",
    "* Content Extraction: Extract and summarize article content\n",
    "* Function Calling: Use OpenAI's function calling to integrate Wikipedia data\n",
    "* Structured Output: Return information in a structured format\n",
    "* Error Handling: Handle cases where articles don't exist or are ambiguous\n",

       "### What Are Neural Networks?\n",
       "\n",
       "**Neural networks** are like smart computer brains. They help computers learn from information so that they can make decisions or predictions, almost like how we learn from our experiences.\n",

       "#### How Do They Work?\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Tiny Neurons**: Imagine little pieces of a brain called **neurons**. Each neuron connects to many others, just like friends passing notes in class.\n",
       "  \n",
       "2. **Layers**: Neurons are grouped into **layers**. There’s an **input layer** (where information comes in), hidden layers (where the computer figures things out), and an **output layer** (where the answer comes out).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Learning through Examples**: Just like you learn by practicing, neural networks learn by seeing lots of examples. They adjust their connections (like changing how you pass notes) to improve their guesses.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Making Predictions**: Once trained, they can guess things like whether a picture is of a cat or a dog!\n",
       "\n",
       "### Why Are They Important?\n",
       "\n",
       "Neural networks are used in many everyday things, like helping robots understand speech, recognizing faces in photos, and suggesting videos online. They help computers work in smarter ways, making them useful in tons of different jobs!\n",

       "### In Summary\n",
