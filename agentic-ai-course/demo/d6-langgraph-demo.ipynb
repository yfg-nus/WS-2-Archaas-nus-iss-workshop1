    "4. **✅ Resolution**: AI generates a professional resolution summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insight:\n",
    "Unlike traditional workflows with hard-coded rules, each decision is made by an LLM that considers context, applies business logic, and makes intelligent routing decisions. The state evolves as it flows through the workflow, building a complete audit trail."
