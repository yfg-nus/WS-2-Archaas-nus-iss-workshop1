    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "This notebook is designed to teach students how to:\n",
    "* Load and configure API keys for reasoning models.\n",
    "* List available OpenAI models programmatically.\n",
    "* Apply best practices for prompting reasoning models.\n",
    "* Use structured formats and few-shot examples to improve model responses.\n",

    "</question>\n",
    "<response>\n",
    "Collaborating with a competitor on a joint marketing campaign can raise antitrust concerns under U.S. antitrust laws, particularly the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 (15 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1‚Äì7). Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits any contract, combination, or conspiracy that unreasonably restrains trade or commerce among the states.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Per Se Illegal Agreements:** Certain collaborations are considered automatically illegal (\"per se\" violations), such as price-fixing, bid-rigging, and market allocation agreements. For example, in *United States v. Topco Associates, Inc.*, 405 U.S. 596 (1972), the Supreme Court held that market division agreements between competitors are per se illegal under the Sherman Act.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rule of Reason Analysis:** Collaborations that are not per se illegal are evaluated under the \"rule of reason,\" which assesses whether the pro-competitive benefits outweigh the anti-competitive effects. In *Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.*, 441 U.S. 1 (1979), the Court recognized that certain joint ventures between competitors can be lawful if they promote competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Information Sharing Risks:** Sharing competitively sensitive information, such as pricing strategies or customer data, can lead to antitrust violations. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission caution against exchanges that could facilitate collusion (*Antitrust Guidelines for Collaborations Among Competitors*, 2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Define the Scope:** Clearly delineate the parameters of the collaboration to focus on the marketing campaign without involving competitive aspects like pricing or market division.\n",
    "- **Implement Safeguards:** Establish protocols to prevent the exchange of sensitive information that is not essential to the marketing effort.\n",
    "- **Legal Consultation:** Given the complexities of antitrust laws, consult with a legal professional to ensure the collaboration complies with all legal requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "While joint marketing campaigns between competitors are not inherently illegal, they must be structured carefully to avoid antitrust pitfalls. Legal guidance is essential to navigate these issues and to design a collaboration that achieves your business objectives without violating antitrust laws.\n",
