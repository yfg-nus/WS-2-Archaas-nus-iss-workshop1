    "# Introduction to AI Agents using Open AI Agents SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook serves as an introduction to AI Agents using the OpenAI Agents SDK. It provides a basic setup for environment configuration and API key management, establishing the foundation for working with OpenAI's agent framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Structure\n",
    "The notebook contains 3 cells:\n",
    "- **Cell 0**: Title and introduction\n",
    "- **Cell 1**: Environment setup and API key configuration\n",
    "- **Cell 2**: Empty cell (placeholder for future content)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries and Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Libraries\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Library Descriptions\n",
    "- **`os`**: Python's built-in operating system interface module\n",
    "  - Used for accessing environment variables via `os.getenv()`\n",
    "- **`python-dotenv`**: Third-party library for loading environment variables from `.env` files\n",
    "  - Provides the `load_dotenv()` function to automatically load environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Key Setup\n",
    "The notebook requires the following environment variable:\n",
    "- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`**: Your OpenAI API key for accessing OpenAI services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Process\n",
    "1. **Environment Loading**: Uses `load_dotenv()` to load variables from a `.env` file\n",
    "2. **API Key Retrieval**: Fetches the OpenAI API key using `os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")`\n",
    "3. **Validation**: Checks if the API key is successfully loaded\n",
    "4. **Security**: Provides optional debugging mode to display the key (disabled by default)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment Setup\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load environment variables from .env file\n",
    "load_dotenv()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch API keys\n",
    "openai_api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Key Validation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Check if API keys are loaded\n",
    "if openai_api_key:\n",
    "    print(\"‚úÖ API keys are successfully loaded.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: One or more API keys are missing.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Features\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Optionally, display API keys (for debugging purposes only)\n",
    "display_keys = False  # Change to True if you want to see the keys\n",
    "\n",
    "if display_keys:\n",
    "    print(f\"OpenAI API Key: {openai_api_key}\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"üîí API keys are loaded but hidden for security.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "1. **Python Environment**: Python 3.x with pip package manager\n",
    "2. **Required Packages**: Install using `pip install python-dotenv`\n",
    "3. **OpenAI Account**: Active OpenAI account with API access\n",
    "4. **Environment File**: Create a `.env` file in the project root\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment File (.env)\n",
    "Create a `.env` file with the following content:\n",
    "```\n",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation Commands\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install python-dotenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure your `.env` file contains the required API key\n",
    "2. **Run the Notebook**: Execute all cells in order\n",
    "3. **Verify Setup**: Check the output messages to confirm API key loading\n",
    "4. **Debug Mode**: Optionally set `display_keys = True` to verify the API key value\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Successful Setup\n",
    "```\n",
    "‚úÖ API keys are successfully loaded.\n",
    "üîí API keys are loaded but hidden for security.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing API Key\n",
    "```\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: One or more API keys are missing.\n",
    "üîí API keys are loaded but hidden for security.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **API Key Protection**: Never commit API keys to version control\n",
    "2. **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files for local development\n",
    "3. **Debug Mode**: Only enable `display_keys = True` for troubleshooting\n",
    "4. **File Permissions**: Ensure `.env` file has appropriate read permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Issues\n",
    "1. **Missing .env file**: Create the file in the project root directory\n",
    "2. **Invalid API key**: Verify the key format and validity in OpenAI dashboard\n",
    "3. **Import errors**: Ensure `python-dotenv` is installed\n",
    "4. **Permission errors**: Check file permissions for the `.env` file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debug Steps\n",
    "1. Set `display_keys = True` to verify API key loading\n",
    "2. Check the `.env` file format and location\n",
    "3. Verify OpenAI API key is active and has sufficient credits\n",
    "4. Test API key manually using OpenAI's API testing tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a foundation for:\n",
    "- Setting up OpenAI Agents SDK projects\n",
    "- Implementing AI agent workflows\n",
    "- Building more complex agent-based applications\n",
    "- Learning the basics of environment configuration for AI projects\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is designed to be extended with additional agent implementations and more sophisticated AI workflows.\n"

       "**LangChain** is a modular framework that enables developers to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It supports integration with various LLMs, provides tools for prompt engineering, and facilitates the creation of complex workflows by chaining together different models and data sources. This flexibility makes it suitable for tasks ranging from conversational agents to document processing.
